**Replace with binder link**

**Note:** This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All data is based on the original [Estimates of Funding for Various Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDC)](https://report.nih.gov/funding/categorical-spending#/). This repository is a class exercise that develops a complete analysis of a dataset that can be found online, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io). Authorship of the original data rests with NIH.
